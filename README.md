# LeadScoring-StoredSQLProcedure
Cannot run due to no database connection. Open in Notepad++ and set language to SQL to view. 

Just to showcase I know how to create a stored procedure and deploy a hard-coded logistic regression model into a SQL Server Production environment.

The logistic regression coefficients are from the corresponding call center lead scoring model I had built. 

Additionally uploaded a seperate stored procedure and a SQL query, both as screenshots.
